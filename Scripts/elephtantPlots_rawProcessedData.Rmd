# Description

This script will take the raw processed data from step one (i.e. a dataset that is well shaped and labelled, but not yet aggregated or with any appropriate issing data imputations etc) and create a series of plots to visualise the data. This will help for quick visual QCs and feasibility checks.

The code can be easily adapted to work on a clean dataset with missing values imputed.
